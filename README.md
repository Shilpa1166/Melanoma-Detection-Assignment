Melanoma Detection using Custom CNN Model
This project involves developing a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model in TensorFlow to accurately detect melanoma from images of skin lesions. The goal is to aid dermatologists by automating the detection process, thereby reducing manual effort and improving early diagnosis.
